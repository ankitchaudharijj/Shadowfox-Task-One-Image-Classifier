# üñºÔ∏è Image Tagging using TensorFlow (CIFAR-10)

This project demonstrates an image classification system using **TensorFlow** and the **CIFAR-10** dataset. It trains a simple Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify images into 10 categories like `cat`, `dog`, `car`, etc. The aim is to show how deep learning can be used to build efficient, real-world image tagging systems.
